# Disassembling the PC :

### Opening the PC:
```bash
• Started by removing the screws to open the panel.
• Slide off the panel.
```
### Disconnecting everything :
```bash
• Unplugging all sorts of cables connected on all pc components.
• Started removing components such as ram, power supply.  
• Unscrewed all motherboard screws (9 in total) and carefully removed the motherboard.
```
###

# Assembling the PC:
```bash
• Lining the holes on the case with the ones on the motherboard, then we screw the motherboard back in.
• Insert the ram stick.  
• Insert the PSU and screw the 4 screws outside the case.  
• We then continued by plugging the psu cables to the mbd such as the 24-pin, 4-pin etc...
• We made sure to properly connect the USB, AUDIO, Power SW, Reset SW cables on the appropriate spots.  
• After that we realised that the PC was missing the Hard Drive, which we would need to download windows.
• After connecting everything we made sure to double check everything.
```
# Starting the PC :
```bash
• Before firing up the PC we have to get our hands on a monitor.
• We start by plugging the power cable onto the PSU and we also need a power cable for the monitor.
• Then we connect the PC tower with the monitor either by HDMI, VGA etc...
• If everything was done accordingly the PC should start fine (fans should be spinning, LED light indications).
```
# Making a bootable USB :
```bash
• Plug your USB into an already working laptop/PC.
• Start by installing RUFUS if you don't already have it.
• Select the ISO file you downloaded (explained below) and then click START.
```
# Installing Windows :  
```bash
• From a different device, start by searching up Win 10/11 ISO file download.
• After that download the version of windows you want to install.
• Unplug the USB and insert it onto the pc you have just assembled.
```
# Installing Windows to the PC :
```bash
• Booting up the computer into BIOS so we can set the USB as the #1 bootable option
• We pick language, accept to the terms etc...
• In between picking Upgrade or Custom installation, we pick Custom and select our HDD.
• For us the HDD wasn't showing up so we had to re-plug it and load it again for it to be picked up.
• After clicking Next we give the PC its time to restart as many times as it needs.
• By this point if the ethernet is plugged in we unplug it to make the Windows setup process easier for us.
• After clicking " I dont have internet" we insert our details, personal passwords, language etc...
• And that should be it, by now our computer should be working perfectly fine.
